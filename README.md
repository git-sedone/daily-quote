# project content
- This project it's not completed, I'm still working on it and it's an `experiment` of what I understood until from the variuos courses;
- I'm trying to put toghether all the concepts I've understood until now, the JavaScript file is still on `work in progress mode`.
- This project returns a random quote from the `github` API every time the `get` button is clicked;
- On the left side there is a `navigation bar` with a button to open and close the bar.
- On the right there is another menu bar which contains a `form`.
- For now only the `get` button to display the `random quote` is working.
